# Cybersecurity Awareness Game

A narrative-driven game designed to teach cybersecurity awareness through interactive scenarios.

## Game Overview

This game presents players with realistic social engineering and cybersecurity scenarios. Players must make decisions that either protect or compromise sensitive information and systems. The game includes four levels, each focusing on different aspects of cybersecurity awareness:

1. **Level 1: Physical Security** - Learn to identify and respond to in-person social engineering attempts.
2. **Level 2: Email Security** - Identify phishing emails and learn to distinguish legitimate communications from malicious ones.
3. **Level 3: Insider Threats** - Navigate complex scenarios involving phone calls, chat messages, and document verification to protect against insider threats.
4. **Level 4: Physical Security - Tailgating** - Identify and respond to tailgating attempts, where unauthorized individuals try to gain physical access by following authorized personnel.

## Features

- **Scoring System**: Earn points for correct security decisions and lose points for security mistakes.
- **Ranking System**: Progress through ranks (Novice, Intermediate, Expert, Elite) based on your score.
- **Achievements**: Unlock achievements for demonstrating security awareness skills.
- **Statistics Tracking**: View your progress, completed levels, and achievements in the Stats screen.

## How to Play

1. Start the game and complete the tutorial to learn the basics.
2. Progress through each level by making security-conscious decisions.
3. Review your performance at the end of each level.

## Level 3: Infiltration - The Insider Threat

This level challenges players with three distinct scenarios:

1. **Phone Call Challenge**: Respond to a suspicious phone call requesting sensitive information.
2. **Chat Challenge**: Navigate a conversation with someone claiming to be a colleague who needs access to sensitive documents.
3. **Document Challenge**: Verify the legitimacy of an invoice before processing payment.

Each scenario tests different aspects of security awareness and requires careful verification of identity and information before taking action.

## Level 4: Physical Security - Tailgating

This level focuses on the physical security threat of tailgating:

1. **Identify Suspicious Behavior**: Recognize when someone is attempting to gain unauthorized access to secure areas.
2. **Enforce Security Protocols**: Ensure proper badge scanning procedures are followed by all personnel.
3. **Report Security Concerns**: Learn when and how to report potential security threats to the appropriate authorities.

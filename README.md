1. **Level 1: Physical Security** - Learn to identify and respond to in-person social engineering attempts.
2. **Level 2: Email Security** - Identify phishing emails and learn to distinguish legitimate communications from malicious ones.
3. **Level 3: Insider Threats** - Navigate complex scenarios involving phone calls, chat messages, and document verification to protect against insider threats.
